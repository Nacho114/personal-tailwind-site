Do not take yourself too seriously, this is also a good maxim vis-Ã -vis other people. Words and even actions may carry much less weight than we think when placed in the proper context. It is thus that the wise do not take themselves nor others too seriously: the proper context is in general opaque.
If the room is dark do not despair. Perhaps it is simply the curtains that are closed.
