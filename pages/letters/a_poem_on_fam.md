Sometimes it rains,

and sometimes the sun shines.

That is the sky.

Sometimes you cry, 

and sometimes you smile.

That is life.

What is life without

clouds crying, what

is life without the

smiling sun?

It is when the clouds cry

that you must smile.

It is when the sun smiles

that you may cry.

What is the sky if not our

family, our friends and perhaps

that one person which can put

a silly smile on our face.

The sky sometimes seems close

and sometimes afar, but it is 

always there with you.

That is the sky.
