## Overview
We will cover the basics of python programming, no prior coding backgroud is assumed.

The video lectures will be given in spanish, but the rest of the content will be given in English.  


## Setup

Here are some basic setup [instructions](https://youtu.be/-8n_WTcn_Ak).

1. Editor: [Visual code studio](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
2. [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

If you are using osx, python 3 should already be installed, if you are in windows, you probably need to [install](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dX2-V2BocqQ) it.

Note: When installing python in windows make sure to tick the box which says ```Add python3.x to PATH```, where 3.x is the version you are installing, anything above 3.0 is ok.


Before we can start with programming we need to be aquinted with the terminal (osx, linux) or with the command line if you are using windows.

The terminal is essentially a way to navigate your compture via commands, and this is useful and important for coding.

1. If you are in windows, I recommend to follow this [guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBBWVgE0ewk)

2. For osx and linux users you can follow [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3YfYVVTYvw).
