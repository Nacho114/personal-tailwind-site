## The code for my personal website

It is based on [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/), [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/what-is-tailwind/) and on the starter made by [taylorbryant](https://github.com/taylorbryant/gatsby-starter-tailwind/blob/master/LICENSE.md). For site deployment I used [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)

I copied the style based on the site of [adamwathan](https://adamwathan.me)
