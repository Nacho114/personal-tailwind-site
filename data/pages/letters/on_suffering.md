The main culprit of suffering is ignorance; It is because we see through a thin shaded window of misunderstandings that we sulk. Our unmatched ability for imagination turns the dagger of ignorance into the sword of sorrow; The shield of wisdom and experience alone stand a chance against such a formidable foe. This is why the wise cultivate wisdom and understanding: they have suffered enough blows to appreciate the urgency of such an endeavor.
Life is (approximately) a finite random process where each subsequent event will be one of three outcomes: joy, indifference or pain (or some combination of them). Experience seems to show that the latter happens often enough to warrant attention. We spend countless hours living the lives of others, we live as kings and beggars in novels and investigators in the latest criminal shows. We travel to satiate curiosity and to bring joy to the spirit. We spend hours honing our musical skills. All this is arguably in the name of joy. What about pain? When do we ever do something in the name of pain that is not destructive?
