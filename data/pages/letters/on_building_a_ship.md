It is not he who is gifted with a great ship at the beginning who wins the race.
It is he who dares to look at his shape for mistakes.
It is he who resolves to improve the mistakes he finds.
It is he who goes through with his resolve. It might take a week, it might take a year, but in the end it is he I say, who shall win the race.
Some things should be done in moderation.
Motivation is not one of them, take all you can,
for it is the fire to become he.
