## While, for loops, and a small program

We learn the concepts of loops (while and for). We also put everything together to make 
a simple program to get user information about members.

In the second video *Putting it all together* we go through together our first relatively big program. You can find the source code for the program [here](https://github.com/Nacho114/python_course/blob/master/course/chapter3/example.py) and for the updated program with for loop [here](https://github.com/Nacho114/python_course/blob/master/course/chapter3/example_for.py)

In video 1 and 2 we learn about 2 different types of loops.

In the last video we learn about summations and how they are related to loops. This part is a bit harder than the rest and also involves some math, but I think it should be accessible for everyone.

### Problems

1. Write a Python program that prints all the numbers from 0 to 6 except 3 and 6. *Console output:* 0 1 2 4 5 

2. Write a Python program to count the number of even and odd numbers from a series of numbers.

Sample numbers : numbers = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9) 

*Console output:*

```python
Number of even numbers : 5
Number of odd numbers : 4
```

3. Write a Python program to create the multiplication table (from 1 to 10) of a number.

*User prompt:*

```python
Input a number: 6                                                       
```

*Console output:*


```python
6 x 1 = 6                                                               
6 x 2 = 12                                                              
6 x 3 = 18                                                              
6 x 4 = 24                                                              
6 x 5 = 30                                                              
6 x 6 = 36                                                              
6 x 7 = 42                                                              
6 x 8 = 48                                                              
6 x 9 = 54                                                              
6 x 10 = 60 
```

4. Write a Python program to construct the following pattern, using a for loop.

```python
* 
* * 
* * * 
* * * * 
* * * * * 
* * * * 
* * * 
* * 
*
```

hint:

```python
print('* '*3) ## output: * * * 
```
